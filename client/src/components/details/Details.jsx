                Do I need a different resume for every different job

              </h2>
              <p>
                Every time you apply for a new job, you should make sure the
                resume speaks directly to the job description. That means, your
                resume may not need to be entirely different, but you’ll likely
                want to make at least a few minor updates. If you’re applying
                for a different type of job, you may want a completely different
                resume, from the content all the way to the format. With all the
                different templates to choose from, take advantage of our resume
                builder and create a variety of resumes to fit both your
                personality and your different job applications.
